# Clojure North 2020: Building Marvelous and Heroic Systems from the Ground Up

Clojure is a fantastically powerful, yet simple language. Despite this assertion,
it is not uncommon for those new to the language to have a hard time grasping
how to build complete applications from the basic building blocks of Clojure.

This tutorial will bridge the gap from the basics of data literals all the way 
to building a complete, stateful web backend application. Participants will 
learn the following key takeaways:

* Clojure is a data-centric language that frees developers to think about their
problems simply and clearly.
* The core functions of Clojure can be thought of as a powerful data DSL that is
appropriate for working and thinking in any domain.
* Powerful libraries exist beyond Clojure core that are also built on 
data-driven and functional concepts.
* Stateful applications can be developed and organized in a functional manner by
pushing state to the edges of their applications and isolating stateful 
components.

For our project we are going to build a really fun and cool application using 
data about hundreds of superheroes. 

Specific activities we will do are:

1. Model our domain as data.
2. Parse existing data files into a usable format.
3. Learn about and use a very powerful family of databases 
(including Datascript & Datahike).
4. Build a backend web application around our superhero database, including a simple Swagger UI.

By the end of the session, you should be able to easily adapt this application 
and lessons learned to your specific domains.
